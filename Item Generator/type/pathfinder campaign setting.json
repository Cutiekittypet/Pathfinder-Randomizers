A traditional klar counts as a light wooden shield with armor spikes; a metal klar counts as a light steel shield with armor spikes. You can bash an opponent with a light shield. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its Armor Class bonus until your next turn. An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.",
