#Item Randomizer
GUI program to generate random magic items from the materials, modifiers, and items listed in json files inside of the material, modifier, and type folders respectively.
Magicalness determines the number of initial rolls for modifiers, and the maximum number of modifiers that can be attached to the item.
Only the item categories "weapons", "armor", "shield", "piecemeal", and "misc" will be properly loaded and rolled for.
Placing files other than json files into the material, modifier, and type folders may cause problems.
